	  <h4>Current position</h4>	
		    I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/">Philosophy Department</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. My dissertation advisor is <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/homepage/kelly.html">Kevin T. Kelly</a>. I have an <b>MSc</b> in <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/phd/lcm-phil/index.html"><b>Logic, Computation and Methodology</b></a> (2015) from the Department of Philosophy</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and <b>BAs</b> in <b>Math, Philosophy</b> (2009) from Brown University.

		    Inductive inference, Ockham's razor, formal epistemology, learning theory, belief revision, topology, statistics and machine learning. <br>
		    <p> I am interested in making reliable inferences from statistical data, both deductive and inductive.  My underlying, epistemological perspective is  <i>feasibility-contextualism</i>, the thesis that epistemic justification consists in adopting the most reliable means for arriving at the true answer to the question under investigation, given the kind of data one can hope to receive. On that view, scientist’s preferences for hypotheses that exhibit theoretical virtues like simplicity, unity, or testability can be epistemically justified only by demonstrating that these preferences are necessary conditions of good truth-finding performance. For example, Ockham’s razor is the characteristic, scientific preference for simpler, more unified, and better testable theories.  There are several, standard, competing explanations of Ockham’s razor in scientific inference, none of which convincingly explains why it is a better method for finding the truth than competing methods would be. In a striking application of feasibility contextualism, Kevin T. Kelly, Clark Glymour, and Oliver Schulte have argued that a version of Ockham’s razor is  <i>necessary</i> for keeping inquiry on the straightest path to the truth.  With Kelly, I have extended  that approach in a number of ways, by refining the exact sense of ``straightest path’’, by refining the underlying definition of empirical simplicity, and by developing a novel theory of belief revision based on Ockham’s razor, that makes more sense for learning and inductive inference than the standard AGM theory.

My dissertation work constitutes a major advance for that approach. The above developments are appealing and suggestive, but they are grounded in a non-statistical account of available information, in which information states are basic neighborhoods in a topological space.  However, real-world scientific questions are all presented in an explicitly probabilistic framework and some critics, including Elliott Sober, have expressed pessimism that the gap between propositional and statistical information can be bridged.  In my thesis work, I answer the skeptics by identifying the unique topology on probability measures whose open sets correspond exactly to the statistical propositions that are probabilistically verifiable.  By means of that pivotal result, I obtain a new  foundation for Ockham’s razor in statistical inductive inference that is securely grounded in the aim of finding the statistical truth, that neither begs the question with a Bayesian prior bias toward simplicity, nor avoids it by changing the subject from inductive inference of theories to selection of models. Those results establish a perspicuous new topological framework in which to study real-life empirical inquiry as it is practiced in machine learning, statistics and the sciences.
